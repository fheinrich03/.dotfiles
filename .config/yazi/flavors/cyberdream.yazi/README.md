</h3>

## Preview

- [github: cyberdream.nvim](https://github.com/scottmckendry/cyberdream.nvim)

## Setup

Setup plugins used in yazi
```bash
brew install trash-cli
brew install coreutils
# maybe you need to add trash-list to your PATH
```

## ⚙️ Usage

Set the content of your `theme.toml` to enable it as your _dark_ flavor:

```toml
[flavor]
dark = "cyberdream"
```

Make sure your `theme.toml` doesn't contain anything other than `[flavor]`, unless you want to override certain styles of this flavor.

See the [Yazi flavor documentation](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/flavors/overview) for more details.
