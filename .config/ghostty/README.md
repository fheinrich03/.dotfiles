# Ghostty Config

## Font
- this config uses the `Jetbrains Mono Nerd Font` from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
- I recommend installing a nerd font of choice and enable it in `ghostty/config`
> Nerd Fonts also come with Web Dev Icons which are required for some of the other modules

## Background Image
- There is a background image already set
- Of course this can be easily replaced 
    - by adding an image to the `ghostty/wallpaper` folder
    - uncommenting the lines for the background in the `ghostty/config`
    - specifying the correct image file e.g. `background-image = "wallpaper/neon-light.jpg"`
